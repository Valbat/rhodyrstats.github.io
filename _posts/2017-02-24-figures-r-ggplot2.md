title: Creating figures with R and ggplot2
text: This short workshop will cover the basics of using R and the ggplot2 package to create figures and save them to image files for use in publications.  The materials will start with the basic assumption that you have at least created a simple scatterplot with ggplot2.  We will cover ways to customize the plot, how to save to a high resolution image file, and explore some additional visualization options (e.g. interactive visualization).
