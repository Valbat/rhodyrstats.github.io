title: Summer of Tidy Data
text: This last summer session will continue to focused on the concept of tidy data and how it applies to your research.  Data managment and data design are something that, if done right, will make your subsequent analysis MUCH easier.  If little thought is given up front, then you'll be spending lots of time at the end.
